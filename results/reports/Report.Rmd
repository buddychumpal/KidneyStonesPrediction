# 1. Background and Data

## 1.1 Background

Is kidney stone prevalence associated with factors such as diet, lifestyle, and other existing medical conditions? Kidney stones are solid deposits of minerals and salts that develop in the urinary tract, and can cause blockage and severe pain when urine is passed (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). It is a common condition that affects approximately 10% of people at least once in their lifetime, and in some cases may require significant and/or recurrent treatment (Abufaraj et al., 2020). 

This report presents an exploratory data analysis, investigating variables previously shown to be associated with kidney stone occurance.  It is based on the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) (NHANES) from the [National Center for Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm), of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/). NHANES is an ongoing program of surveys in the United States that assesses the health and nutritional status of adults and children. The surveys collect health-related data ranging over a number of topics, which are organised broadly into Demographics, Dietary, Examination, Laboratory, and Questionnaire. It is widely used to analyse or identify associative or causal factors of various conditions and/or diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hearing loss. Thus, the comprehensive scope of NHANES makes it an ideal resource to investigate factors associated with kidney stones, especially given the diverse range of known causes.

In the following sections, we evaluate the completeness, quality, and distributions of kidney stone-relevant data in NHANES. The aim is to explore and identify potentially suitable features for developing a machine learning model to predict kidney stone prevalence using the NHANES dataset.

Data from the most recent cycle is used, [NHANES 2017 - March 2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?Cycle=2017-2020).

## 1.2 Data Structure and Types

```{r}
df <- read.csv("../../data/merged_data_clean.csv")
```

Data from each NHANES cycle is released as many tables, each containing a collection of similar features. For the specific focus on kidney stone disease, only a subset of tables is used, and from these tables, only a subset of key features. The integrated dataset used in this project is composed of `r nrow(df)` instances/rows, and `r ncol(df)` columns. The column `SEQN` contains a unique identifier for each instance, and the column `KIQ026` contains the target variable. Thus, there are `r ncol(df) - 2` informative features. 

The target variable belongs to the Questionnaire component of NHANES, and is phrased as "Ever had kidney stones?". Possible answers of this question are "Yes", "No", "Refused", and "Don't know". Only Yes/No are used as the binary classification label of this project (details are discussed in Section 1.4: Data Integration).

Counts (and proportions) of the binary target variable classes are as follows:

* Yes, has had kidney stones: 866 instances (`r signif((sum(df$KIQ026 == 1)/nrow(df)), 4)`)
* No, has not had kidney stones: 8342 instances (`r signif(sum(df$KIQ026 == 2)/nrow(df), 4)`)

The key features are broadly described in the following:

* Demographic: gender, age, race, education, marital status, and income. Men and older individuals are more likely to have had kidney stones (Lieske et al., 2014), and there is evidence that kidney stone prevalence and severity is associated with various socioeconomic factors (Bayne et al., 2019; Trivedi et al., 2008; Winitzki et al., 2022). 
* Dietary: vitamin, water, nutrient, and dietary supplement intake. Kidney stone incidence increases with certain dietary habits, such as low calcium, low potassium, and low fluid diets (Cappucio et al., 1990; Chewcharat et al., 2022). Everyday foods in the NHANES dietary interviews are deconstructed and aggregated into their nutritional components, thus there is highly specific (and largely correlated) dietary and nutrient data that constitutes a significant portion of the total features explored.
* Examination: body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and pulse readings. Indicators of general health are useful predictive features for kidney stone risk (Cappucio et al., 1990; Jeong et al., 2011).
* Laboratory: aspects of biochemistry profile, and urine-associated tests. Kidney diseases or urinary tract abnormalities (that can lead to kidney stones) have been associated with abnormal urinary levels of components such as glucose, lead, and albumin creatinine ratio (Spatola et al., 2016). Studies using NHANES, by Chewcharat & Curhan (2020) and Sun et al. (2019), have previously assessed prevalence of kidney stones in comparison to relevant laboratory values.
* Questionnaire: past medical history (conditions and medicines), dietary and alcohol habits, urinary tract function, physical activity, smoking, and sleep habits. Again, general health, behaviours, and lifestyle have a large influence on kidney stone disease (Li et al., 2014; Xue et al., 2024). Factors such as lack of physical activity and smoking can indirectly damage the urinary tract and promote stone formation (Lieske, 2013; Soueidan et al., 2015).

Feature type ranges from numerical continuous and discrete to categorical binary, nominal, and ordinal. Dietary, examination, and laboratory data are mainly numerical, while demographic and questionnaire data are mainly categorical. To avoid difficult or complicated natural languange processing or text mining, free-text data was not selected.

Counts of feature types and brief examples are as follows:

* 97 numerical features, e.g. energy in kilocalories (continuous); age in years (discrete)
* 49 categorical features, e.g. gender (binary: male, female); race (nominal: Mexican American, other Hispanic, white, etc.); diet healthiness (ordinal: excellent, very good, fair, etc.)

## 1.3 Data Completeness

```{r}
na_df <- read.csv("../figures/na_prop.csv")
```

`r sum(na_df$Proportion == 0) - 2` features have no missing values (not including the unique identifier and target variable columns). 

Features that do have missing data can be summarised as follows:

* `r sum((na_df$Proportion > 0) & (na_df$Proportion <= 0.25))` features have under 25% missing data; 
* `r sum((na_df$Proportion > 0.25) & (na_df$Proportion <= 0.50))` features have 25 - 50% missing data; 
* `r sum((na_df$Proportion > 0.5) & (na_df$Proportion <= 0.75))` features have 50 - 75% missing data; 
* `r sum((na_df$Proportion > 0.75) & (na_df$Proportion <= 1))` features have 75% - 100% missing data.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/na_prop.png")
```

Figure 1: a) Count of features with various missing data proportions. b) Missing data proportions of the features containing above 20% missing data. `URDFLOW1`: urine #1 flow rate; `DBD900`: # meals from fast food/pizza place; `BPXOPLS1`: pulse, 1st osocillometric reading; `BPXOPLS2`: pulse, 2nd oscillometric reading; `BPXOPLS3`: pulse, 3rd oscillometric reading; `DSDANTA`: taking antacid; `ALQ130`: average # alcoholic drinks/day; `RDXCOUNT`: # precription medicines taken; `RXDDAYS`: # days taken medicine; `DBD100`: how often add salt to food at table; `LBXGLU`: fasting glucose; `SMQ040`: smoke cigarettes; `BPQ050A`: taking prescribed medicine for HBP; `KIQ010`: how much urine lose [during urinary leakage]; `URXUPB`: lead, urine; `SMD470`: # people who smoke inside home; `DIQ070`: take diabetic pills; `DSQTKCAL`: energy (kcal);  `DIQ050`: taking insulin; `URDFLOW2`: urine #2 flow rate; `DSD128V`: [take supplement] for kidney, bladder; `DSD128FF`: [take supplement] for liver health, detoxification; `URDFLOW3`: urine #3 flow rate.

Overall, the majority of features do not contain a substantial proportion of missing data (Figure 1a). Features with very large proportions of missing data should be discarded as they are likely to be uninformative.

Over half of features have less than 20% missing data (Figure 1a). Features from the table "Dietary Interview - Total Nutrient Intakes" ([P_DR1TOT](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_DR1TOT.htm)) are the main contributors to this particular proportion. A large number of features were selected from that table, and data collected within pertains to a consistent subset of people. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that features originating from the same or similar NHANES tables will share comparable patterns of missing data. For example, features related to dietary intake will only have recorded values for those who partook in dietary interviews, which may differ from the set of people who partook in laboratory tests. This pattern can also be seen in Figure 1b with the set of features `BPXOPLS1`, `BPXOPLS2`, and `BPXOPLS3`, which correspond to successive pulse readings and have identical missing value proportions (~25%).

`KIQ010`, `DSD128V`, and `DSD128FF` are features with very high percentages of missing data (over 50%), as seen in Figure 1b. They have structural missingness - e.g. in the case of `KIQ010`, recording a value for the amount of urine lost is dependent on the participant affirming that they have had urinary leakage, which most participants have not. Likewise, `DSD128V` and `DSD128FF` are both dependent on the participant affiriming that they do take supplements, which, again, may not be the case for most.

It is important to consider missing data when combining or transforming features. Creating another feature that is an average of all three pulse readings (`BPXOPLS1, BPXOPLS2, BPXOPLS3`) will not result in loss of instances, as the features have equivalent proportions of missing data (assumed to belong to the same instances). However, creating a feature that is the average of urine flow rates (`URDFLOW1, URDFLOW2, URDFLOW3`) will result in loss of instances, as all have different proportions of missing data; `URDFLOW3` has nearly 100% missing data, `URDFLOW2` has close to 90%, and `URDFLOW1` has approximately 20%. It is wiser to simply preserve the feature with the least missing data (`URDFLOW1`), instead of attempting feature combination.

## 1.4 Data Integration

Individual tables were obtained from the [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) site and joined along the unique respondent sequence number variable, `SEQN`, regardless of unmatched `SEQN`s or missing values in features (full outer join). For any subsequent duplicate instances (determined by duplicate `SEQN`), the first instance was taken.

All instances with missing values, recorded "Refused", or "Don't know" for the target variable were then removed from the data.

# 2. Ethics, Privacy, and Security

## 2.1 Ethical Considerations

Brook
[Discuss ethical considerations relevant to your project, such as potential biases in the data or implications of findings]

## 2.2 Privacy Concerns

Personal health data is extremely sensitive information, making privacy a huge concern. This is a widely recognised concern however, which means there is a great deal of legislation we and NHANES need to be in line with. 

As our data is from the NHANES dataset, which is part of a program by a governmental agency of the United Stated of America, and the data is about those who reside in the United States, we must consider the laws, protections, and regulations the USA has, as well as the laws of our own country and the laws of social acceptance. While we may not be the ones who collected the data or released it, we are not relinquished of our moral duties. Using data that doesn’t meet privacy standards could lead to legal trouble and societal backlash, so ensuring our data already meets privacy standards - and if not, taking steps to ensure it does - is key.  

The United States of America currently has 4 federal laws that cover patient privacy in regards to the NHANES survey data – these are: 

The Privacy Act of 1974 - requires that data about an individual cannot be released without the individual’s consent (Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties | Privacy Act of 1974, 2014) 

The Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act – states if information is gathered for statistical purposes, it should only be used for statistical purposes, that an individual should not identifiable, and that confidentiality should be safeguarded by controlling access to the information. (2.11 Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (2002), n.d.) 

The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act – requires agencies to have appropriate cybersecurity measures and plans in place (S.1353 - 113th Congress (2013-2014): Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014, 2014) 

Section 308(d) of the Public Health Service Act – similar to The Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, it states that a person should not be identifiable, and that the data may only be used for the purpose it was supplied for. (TITLE III-GENERAL POWERS and DUTIES of PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE PART A-RESEARCH and INVESTIGATION in GENERAL, 2020) 

(NHANES - Participant - Your Privacy, 2021) (National Center for Health Statistics, 2013)  

NHANES is currently in compliance with the above acts, and by using the data for statistical purposes, we are in compliance with The Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act. However, the United States of America also has differing data privacy laws state-by-state (Pittman, 2023), and as the NHANES survey is national, participants will be from a variety of states and therefore have different privacy standards. These state level data privacy laws are typically surrounding consumer data and corporations, as opposed to governmental survey data, but are still important to consider. While geographic information is collected as part of NHANES, its use is limited and restricted, so we are unable to verify ourselves if NHANES is complying with the state laws, and the NHANES privacy page and brochure were both released prior to state privacy laws coming into effect. States are also continuing to roll out new privacy laws and not all are yet in effect, and so even if the data is currently legally sound in terms of privacy, this may change in the coming years. While we may not know NHANES and our own exact legality stance in the states currently, we do know that the information that NHANES releases to the public has no identifiable information, only those with special permissions can access some identifiers (such as geographic location), and these steps ensure patient confidentiality. 

## 2.3 Security Measures

To ensure the security of the NHANES dataset and compliance with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) requirements, our project has implemented a set of data security measures. For example, the NHANES dataset is stored in an access-controlled GitHub repository. Our processed data is stored in the /data/ directory, and all the raw data is stored in the /data/raw_data directory. Access to these directories are restricted to only authorized group members. We utilize Github's repository permissions and collaborator settings to control access to the repository and specific directories, with read/write permissions granted only to those who require access to the data for their specific tasks.

All data transfers are conducted using secure, encrypted protocols, such as HTTPS for GitHub interactions. We also maintain detailed audit trails, so group member could pull request and review it together, leveraging GitHub's built-in version control and logging capabilities to track all data access and modifications.

Access permissions are regularly reviewed using our logs and updated to align with group members' current tasks and responsibilities. This ensures that access rights remain current and appropriate throughout the project lifecycle. We have also implemented a data minimization strategy, ensuring that only essential NHANES data relevant to the project is stored and processed.

Upon completion of the project, all data files and any derived data will be deleted from local computers and GitHub's repository. This ensures that the data is not retained unnecessarily and reduces the risk of unauthorized access or disclosure after the project's conclusion.

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

## 3.1 Demographic Analysis

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/demo_ks_prev.png")
```

Figure 2: a) Density distribution of age across those who have had kidney stones and those who have not. b) Proportion of males and females within their respective groups who have had kidney stones. c) Proportion of various races within their respective groups who have had kidney stones. d) Proportion of various education levels within their respective groups who have had kidney stones. The category "Refused" was removed due to low count. e) Proportion of various marital statuses within their respective groups who have had kidney stones. The categories "Refused" and "Don't Know" were removed due to low count. f) Density distribution of ratio of family income to poverty guidelines.

At a younger age (20 - 40 years of age), a notably higher proportion of people have never had kidney stones as opposed to have (Figure 2a). As age increases (> 50 years of age), the proportion of people who have never had kidney stones becomes less than those who have. The overall prevalence of having had kidney stones increases steadily from 20 - 40 years of age, plateaus after 40 years of age, then increases again to peak at ~60 years of age.

Figure 2b shows that approximately 10% of males have had kidney stones, while a lesser percentage of around 8% of females have. Thus, kidney stones among males are slightly higher than the overall prevalence of kidney stones (~9.4%), while females are slightly below.

There is clear fluctuation in kidney stone prevalence among different races (Figure 2c), with Asian and Black people at the lowest (just above 5% have had kidney stones), increasing to Mexican Americans (approximately 8%). Races with kidney stone prevalence greater than the overall prevalence are other Hispanic (over 10%), other/multiracial, and White people (latter two are close to 15%). There is a large distinction (~10%) between the lowest and highest prevalence. The low and high proportions are also significantly different from the overall kidney stone prevalence.

As education level changes, the proportion of those who have had kidney stones fluctuates, but there is no obvious trend among successive education levels (Figure 2d). The difference between the education level with the highest kidney stone prevalence (college/AA degree at ~10%) and lowest (high school grad/GED at ~8%) is relatively minimal.

Those that are married/living with partner or widowed/divorced/separated show a greater prevalence of kidney stones than those that have never married, as seen in Figure 2e. Never married people also have a much lower prevalence than overall kidney stone prevalance. However, this may be due to the confounding factor of age, instead of an inherent characteristic of marriage that increases kidney stone occurance.

In Figure 2f, a ratio close to 1 means family income is approximately equal to poverty thresholds; greater than 1 means family income is above poverty thresholds. At a lower to middle ratio (0 - 4), it is slightly more common to not have had kidney stones, but not significantly. At a higher ratio (> 4), there is a large difference - the prevalence of never having had kidney stones is notably higher than having had them. 

Overall, Figure 2 indicates that nearly all demographic features - age, gender, marital status, race, and ratio of family income to poverty guidelines - are associated with prevalence of kidney stones. Confirming previous research, older people and males are more likely to have had kidney stones. Age may be a confounding factor in the apparent association of kidney stone occurance with marital status, but regardless it can still be a useful feature. The lack of significant association between education level and kidney stones indicate that it might be uninformative in a predictive context.

## 3.2 Health Conditions Analysis

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/cond_ks_prop.png")
```

Figure 3: The proportion of people with various other conditions who also have had kidney stones.

Gallstones and weak/failing kidneys are the most strongly associated with kidney stone occurance, with close to 25% of people having (either or both of) those conditions also having had kidney stones. Between ~11% and ~15% of people who have the remaining conditions also have had kidney stones. All these are much higher than overall kidney stone prevalence (9.4%), indicating that these features are likely to be useful for a predictive model. It can be noted that some of these conditions may also possess a high degree of correlation between each other, which may be reflected in their similar proportions in Figure 3, e.g. being overweight and having high cholesterol. Feature combination/transformation could be used to reduce dimensionality.

## 3.3 Laboratory Analysis

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/lab_dist.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/corrlab.png")
```

Figure 4: Density distributions of laboratory features, split by those who have had kidney stones and have not had kidney stones. a) Fasting glucose. b) Blood urea nitrogen. c) Total calcium. d) Uric acid. e) Albumin creatinine ratio. f) Lead in urine. g) Shows the Pearson Correlation values between the laboratory results, not discriminant of kidney stone status.

Figure 4 shows that most laboratory features appear within expected ranges, with the exception of uric acid (Figure 4d). There appears to be outlier(s) skewing this feature with up to 10000 mg/dL uric acid, which is likely to be an error as ordinary uric acid levels should not exceed the single-digit mg/dL range. 

Distribution shape of laboratory features remains relatively identical, regardless of kidney stone status. Distributions for fasting glucose (Figure 4a) and total calcium (Figure 4c) are shifted slightly right (towards higher values) for those who have had kidney stones. The peak bin for blood urea nitrogen (Figure 4b) is at a marginally lower value for those who have had kidney stones in comparison to those who have not. Albumin creatinine ratio appears to peak later, and remain slightly higher, at increasing mg/g for those who have had kidney stones (Figure 4e). Distributions for lead (Figure 4f) and uric acid are consistent for both kidney stone statuses - however, detail in the uric acid histogram may be obscured by the outlier(s). 

Figure 4 indicates that uric acid and lead are not associated with kidney stone prevalence. The remaining laboratory features are associated due to differing distributions according to kidney stone status.
lation values, indicating that the lab
When looking at the correlation between the laboratory features (figure 4g) we can see many close to 0 Pearson correoratory features are not strongly correlated. Because of this, it would be unreasonable to exclude any of these features based off of these values alone. The largest Pearson values here are seen with fasting glucose, but even this does not exceed 0.31, and a value of at least 0.7, or close to, would be needed to state a strong relationship. A compounding of other factors (correlation with other predictors, relationship to our kidney stones response variable, number of total features) would be needed to justify removing any of these predictors based off of their Pearson correlation values.

## 3.4 Dietary Analysis

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/dietary_difference.png")
```

Figure 5: Dietary Differences

Alcohol consumption shows the largest negative difference (-25.2%), indicating that individuals who have had kidney stones tend to consume significantly less alcohol. This the studies have shown that excessive alcohol intake can increase the risk of kidney stone formation by causing dehydration and altering urine composition (Ferraro et al., 2013, Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology).

In addition, Alpha-carotene and beta-carotene (both forms of vitamin A) display substantial negative differences (-24.0% and -13.8% respectively), with those who have had kidney stones consuming less. This unexpected finding warrants further investigation, as some studies have suggested that higher intake of fruits and vegetables rich in carotenoids may be associated with lower risk of kidney stones (Sorensen et al., 2014, Journal of Urology).

In contrast, another form of vitamin A, Retinol, shows a positive difference (+11.5%), contrasting with the carotenoid findings. This discrepancy highlights the complex relationship between different forms of vitamin A and kidney stone risk. Some research has indicated that excessive vitamin A intake may increase kidney stone risk (Tang et al., 2012, Annals of Internal Medicine), which could explain why those with a history of stones consume less carotenoids but more retinol.

Caffeine and theobromine show the largest positive differences (+14.4% and +13.9%). While caffeine has been associated with increased risk of kidney stones in some studies (Ferraro et al., 2014, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition), the higher intake in those with a history of stones could reflect changes in fluid consumption patterns post-diagnosis.

Lycopene intake is 10.1% higher in those with a history of kidney stones. Some research suggests that lycopene may have protective effects against kidney stone formation due to its antioxidant properties (Yencilek et al., 2010, Urological Research), which makes this finding particularly interesting.

Vitamin C intake is 8.4% lower in individuals who have had kidney stones. This aligns with some studies suggesting that high-dose vitamin C supplementation may increase kidney stone risk (Thomas et al., 2013, JAMA Internal Medicine), potentially leading to reduced intake in those with a history of stones.

Among the top factors, we see a trend in vitamins and antioxidants, particularly forms of vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol). This pattern suggests that the balance and forms of certain vitamins may be different in individuals with a history of kidney stones.

## 3.5 Physical Activity Analysis

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/combined_kidney_stones_graphs.png")
```

Figure 6: Association between Kidney Stone History, Sedentary Behavior, and Physical Activity Patterns

Figure 6a shows quite similar sitting time distributions between those with and without kidney stone history. This observation contrasts with earlier findings by Wang et al. (2023) from 2007-2016 data, which suggested an increasing trend in kidney stone prevalence with increased sitting time among less active individuals. This difference could indicate a shift in the relationship between sedentary behavior and kidney stones over time, or reflect changes in lifestyle patterns in recent years. 

There is small secondary peak at around 10,000 minutes (~167 hours) of sitting time and negative minutes spent sitting in both groups likely represents outliers or data entry errors.

Examining physical activity patterns, we observe slight differences in recreational activities between those with and without kidney stone history. For moderate-intensity sports, fitness, or recreational activities (38.5% vs. 40.4%), vigorous-intensity activities (21.0% vs. 24.0%), and walking or cycling for at least 10 minutes continuously (19.6% vs. 22.9%), individuals without kidney stone history report marginally higher participation rates. While these differences are small, they align with findings from Sorensen et al. (2014, Journal of Urology), who reported that higher levels of physical activity were associated with lower risk of kidney stones. This association might be explained by the positive effects of exercise on metabolism, body composition, and hydration status (Qin et al., 2018, American Journal of Kidney Diseases).

Interestingly, for work-related physical activities, we see a reverse trend. Those with kidney stone history report slightly higher rates of work-related moderate-intensity activity (44.7% vs. 43.0%) and work-related vigorous-intensity activity (27.8% vs. 24.7%). This distinction between recreational and occupational physical activity in relation to kidney stone history is intriguing and warrants further investigation. It may suggest that the context and nature of physical activity, not just the intensity, could play a role in kidney stone risk. Occupational physical activity might have different physiological effects compared to recreational exercise, possibly due to differences in hydration patterns, stress levels, or other workplace factors (Coenen et al., 2018, Occupational and Environmental Medicine).

The complex relationship between physical activity and kidney stone risk underscores the need for more nuanced research in this area. Future studies should consider not only the quantity but also the quality and context of physical activity, as well as potential confounding risk factors.



## 3.6 Risk Factor Analysis
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/Risk_Factor_Analysis.png")
```
Figure 8: The risk of smoke to kidney stone 

In this graph you can see the proportion of people who have kidney stone or not for people with some certain characteristics(smoke more then 1000 time in their life,smoke less then 1000 time in their life, don’t know and refuse to answer). In this case, I will not account for people who answer I don’t know and refuse. Since number of them is low, and I am not sure if I should assume that they smoke too little, so they think it is not important, or they smoke a lot.So just look people who smoke more then 1000 time in their life(Yes) and smoke less then 1000 time in their life(No). You can see the proportion of kidney stone for people who answer yes is higher then who answer no. From this it show the correlation between risk of kidney stone and smoking and it back up the research that say their is causation between risk of kidney stone and smoking. 

Figure 9: The risk of number of prescriptions taken to kidney stone 

In this graph you can see that I create a plot box to see in average the number of prescriptions taken by people who have kidney stone or not. It is show that the number of people who have kidney stone tend to have higher number of prescriptions taken 9 compare to people who don’t have kidney stone. From this it show the correlation between risk of kidney stone and number of prescriptions taken and it back up the research that say their is causation between risk of kidney stone and number of prescriptions taken. 

Figure 10: The risk of trouble sleeping to kidney stone Note(told doctor about having trouble sleeping mean that they have issue about sleeping and didn’t told doctor about having trouble sleeping mean that they have don’t issue about sleeping) 

In this graph you can see the proportion of people who have kidney stone or not for people with some certain characteristics(having a sleeping issue, don’t have a sleeping issue, don’t know and refusing to answer). In this case, I will not account for people who answer I don’t know and refuse. Since number of them is low, and I am not sure if I should assume they they having trouble sleeping or not. So just look people who having trouble sleeping(Yes) and people who didn’t having trouble sleeping(No). You can see the proportion of kidney stone for people who answer yes is higher then who answer no. From this it show the correlation between risk of kidney stone and smoking and it back up the research that say their is causation between risk of kidney stone and having sleeping issue.
